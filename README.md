# Signal-Alignment
Welcome to Signal-Alignment! This is an initiative to create educational infographics and animated explainers for understanding AI alignment research projects. My goal is to make AI alignment research more accessible and encourage more people to contribute to the development of safe and beneficial AI.

## Understanding the Problem and Target Audience
The lack of accessible educational resources in the field of AI alignment creates a barrier to entry for individuals who want to contribute. That's why I created Signal-Alignment to target individuals who are new to AI alignment and those who have limited technical knowledge. I also aim to create resources for specific communities.

## Design Process
To ensure accessibility, I design the resources with simplicity and clarity in mind. The design process involves brainstorming ideas, researching and gathering information, sketching and prototyping, and designing and refining the resources. I use AI tools where ethical to assist in the design process.

## Where to begin
Signal-Alignment has created infographics and a short explainer for David Shapiro's Heuristic alignment theory. View these directly by clicking on the files in this repository above. More projects and their progress can be found in the projects tab.

## Finding More Educational Resources
While Signal-Alignment provides an introduction to AI alignment, deeper reading and research is necessary for a thorough understanding of the field. Here are a few resources to help you get started:
