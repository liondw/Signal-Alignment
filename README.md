# Signal-Alignment ðŸ“¡
Welcome to the **Signal-Alignment** project! This is an initiative to create **educational resources, infographics, and animated explainers** for understanding the latest community AI alignment research projects. My goal is use clear, concise design to make AI alignment research more accessible and encourage more people to contribute to the development of safe and beneficial AI.

## Understanding the Problem âš 
**We are at a crossroads** in AI development, fast approaching AGI and superintelligent Autonomous AI. There are many valid concerns ranging from **security, identity theft, misalignment, and malicious bad faith actors.** Currently, AI alignment research is **severely lagging behind** other advancements in AI technology. **Alignment of AI is an urgent matter** for which I believe the vast majority of society has had little to no awareness or say on.

**The lack of accessible educational** resources in the field of AI alignment creates a barrier to entry for individuals who want to contribute. That's why I created Signal-Alignment to target individuals who are **actively working in all open source AI projects**, and even people who are **new to AI alignment** or have limited technical knowledge. If you have an idea or resource you would like to suggest, you can contact me below.

## Design Process âœ’
To ensure accessibility, I design the resources with simplicity and clarity in mind. The design process involves brainstorming ideas, researching and gathering information, sketching and prototyping, and designing and refining the resources. I use AI tools where ethical to assist in the design process. You can **view my projects in progress in the projects tab above**.

## Where to begin ðŸ–¼
I have created an [**Introduction to David Shapiro's Heuristic Imperatives**](https://github.com/liondw/Signal-Alignment/blob/fa69338c872d87436c011488891b603bd14dd557/Heuristic%20Imperatives%20-%20Definitions%20and%20Summary%20Apr%2011.pdf), and am working on a companion short explainer video for easier direct sharing. View these directly by clicking on the files and folders in this repository above.

More projects to come, view progress in the projects tab above.

## Finding More Educational Resources ðŸ“š
While Signal-Alignment provides an introduction to AI alignment, deeper reading and research is necessary for a thorough understanding of the field. **Here are a few resources to help you get started:**

**David Shapiro - Author of Benevolence by Design and AI researcher**

**AI Safety Community document - links to other community alignment efforts**

## Contact me ðŸ“ž
If you have questions, would like to contribute, or have topic suggestions, feel free to reach out on our discussion page or at signal.alignment@gmail.com.

An early part of the Signal-Alignment initiative will be offering design and non-code contributions to others.
For projects that I decide to take on, I am able to assist you with:
- Branding
- Logo
- Colour Palette
- Designing landing pages for a product
- Formatting your README files
- Creating design assets (images, social media posts)
