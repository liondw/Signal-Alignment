# Signal-Alignment ðŸ“¡
Welcome to the **Signal-Alignment** project! This is an initiative to create **educational infographics and animated explainers** for understanding AI alignment research projects. My goal is use clear, concise design to make AI alignment research more accessible and encourage more people to contribute to the development of safe and beneficial AI.

## Understanding the Problem âš 
**The lack of accessible educational** resources in the field of AI alignment creates a barrier to entry for individuals who want to contribute. That's why I created Signal-Alignment to target individuals who are **new to AI alignment** and those who have limited technical knowledge. I also aim to contribute resources for specific open source community efforts in need of designers.

## Design Process âœ’
To ensure accessibility, I design the resources with simplicity and clarity in mind. The design process involves brainstorming ideas, researching and gathering information, sketching and prototyping, and designing and refining the resources. I use AI tools where ethical to assist in the design process. You can **view my projects in progress in the projects tab above**.

## Where to begin ðŸ–¼
I have created infographics and a short explainer video for **David Shapiro's Heuristic alignment theory**. View these directly by clicking on the folders in this repository above.


More projects to come.

## Finding More Educational Resources ðŸ“š
While Signal-Alignment provides an introduction to AI alignment, deeper reading and research is necessary for a thorough understanding of the field. **Here are a few resources to help you get started:**

**David Shapiro - Author of Benevolence by Design and AI researcher**

An early part of the Signal-Alignment initiative will be offering design and non-code contributions to others.
For projects that I decide to take on, I am able to assist you with:
- Branding
- Logo
- Colour Palette
